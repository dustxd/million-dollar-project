  description: "The Bullet Journaling App is a web app created by three UBC students. Inspired by Ryder Caroll's Bullet Journal Method, this app lets users bullet journal digitally. Constrasting to its paper counterpart, this digital journal allows easy access with our search function, and displays the journal in multiple views (weekly and daily). It aims to help users keep track of their habits, sort their daily activities, and plan for their future goals, without having to spend time setting up their journals from scratch.",
